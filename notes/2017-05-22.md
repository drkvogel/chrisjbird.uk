and gulp calls it and builds to `_site`.

### oktimer still on localhost:3000

https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/codelabs/offline/
>Once a service worker is installed to a scope such as localhost:3000 (you'll learn more about scope in the next section), that service worker automatically starts up every time that you access the scope, unless you programmatically or manually delete it.
>To fix this, go to the Application panel of DevTools, click on the Service Workers tab, and then click the Unregister button. In the screenshot below the mouse is hovering over the button.

css - Font Awesome not working, icons showing as squares - Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14366158/font-awesome-not-working-icons-showing-as-squares)
but none of the solutions seem to apply - the classes already include `fa` as well as `fa-<icon-name>`, e.g.:

```html
<i class="fa fa-github icon" aria-hidden="true"></i>
```

>modified font-awesome.min.css, replacing relative path with absolute path

?

put:

```
# Allow access from all domains for webfonts.
# Alternatively you could only whitelist your
# subdomains like "subdomain.example.com".
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
  <FilesMatch "\.(ttf|ttc|otf|eot|woff|font.css|css)$">
    Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
  </FilesMatch>
</IfModule>
```

put `.htaccess` from [.htaccess Examples - MaxCDN Support Site](https://www.maxcdn.com/one/tutorial/htaccess-example-collection/) - no dice.


in .htaccess?
